# rustomata

Framework for (weighted) automata with storage


##
main functionalities:
* *parsing* of LCFRSs using their *Chomsky-Schützenberger* characterisation
* *parsing* of PMCFGs/MCFGs/LCFRSs and CFGs using their *automata* characterisation
* *approximation* of MCFGs/LCFRSs and CFGs using several approximation strategies
* *coarse-to-fine parsing* of MCFGs/LCFRSs and CFGs using their *automata* characterisation (under construction)

## quick start
* create a grammar file
  ```bash
  cat <<EOF > example.mcfg
  initial: [S]
  S → [[Var 0 0, Var 1 0, Var 0 1, Var 1 1]] (A, B)
  A → [[T a, Var 0 0],  [T c, Var 0 1]     ] (A   )   # 0.5
  A → [[],  []                             ] (    )   # 0.5
  B → [[T b, Var 0 0],  [T d, Var 0 1]     ] (B   )   # 0.5
  B → [[],  []                             ] (    )   # 0.5
  EOF
  ```
* construct a tree-stack automaton from the given grammar, print out that automaton
  ```bash
  cargo run mcfg automaton grammar.gr
  ```
* construct a tree-stack automaton from the given grammar and recognise the word "a a b c c d", print out a best (maximum weight) accepting configuration (if there is one)
  ```bash
  echo "a a b c c d" | cargo run mcfg parse grammar.gr
  ```


## the grammar formats

Rustomata can deal with multiple context-free grammars (short: MCFGs) and context-free grammars (short: CFGs).
MCFGs are expressively equivalent to linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRSs) and simple range concatenation grammars (sRCG).
The algorithms of rustomata use automata (tree-stack automata, short: TSA, for PMCFGs; and pushdown automata, short: PDA, for CFGs) or the Chomsky-Schützenberger representation to deal with grammars.
The weights are (for now) assumed to be from the algebra (ℝ₊, ⋅, 1) of non-negative reals with multiplication; any parser considers greater values to be better.

### an example of an MCFG (in the notation of an sRCG):

```
initial non-terminals: only S

productions:
S(x₁y₁x₂y₂) ← A(x₁, x₂) B(y₁, y₂)  with weight 1
A(ax₁, cx₂) ← A(x₁, x₂)            with weight 0.5
A(ε, ε)     ← ε                    with weight 0.5
B(by₁, dy₂) ← B(y₁, y₂)            with weight 0.5
B(ε, ε)     ← ε                    with weight 0.5
```

* the same grammar in rustomata's notation:
  ```
  initial: [S]
  
  S → [[Var 0 0, Var 1 0, Var 0 1, Var 1 1]] (A, B)
  A → [[T a, Var 0 0],  [T c, Var 0 1]     ] (A   )   # 0.5
  A → [[],  []                             ] (    )   # 0.5
  B → [[T b, Var 0 0],  [T d, Var 0 1]     ] (B   )   # 0.5
  B → [[],  []                             ] (    )   # 0.5
  ```
* Lines that contain no non-whitespace characters are ignored by the parser.
* Lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `%` are also ignored (comments).
* A single production *may not* contain newline characters.
* A production may be followed by a comment (starting with `%`).
* The weight definition (e.g. `# 1.0`) may be omitted.  Rustomata then assumes a weight of `1.0`.

### an example of a CFG:
```
initial non-terminals: S

S → a S b    with weight 0.4
S → ε        with weight 0.6
```

* the same grammar in rustomata's notation:
  ```
  initial: [S]
  
  S → [T a, Nt A, T b]  # 0.4
  S → []                # 0.6
  ```
* The parser specifics of MCFGs also apply for CFGs.

## constructing automata

* create a tree-stack automaton that is equivalent to the given MCFG:
  ```bash
  cargo run mcfg automaton example.mcfg
  ```
* create a push-down automaton that is equivalent to the given CFG:
  ```bash
  cargo run cfg automaton example.cfg
  ```

## recognition functionality

* parse an MCFG (internally constructing an tree-stack automaton):
  ```bash
  cargo run mcfg parse grammar.gr
  ```

* parse a CFG (internally constructing a pushdown automaton):
  ```bash
  cargo run cfg parse grammar.gr
  ```

## Chomsky-Schützenberger parsing for LCFRS

### construct a Chomsky-Schützenberger representation (binary file) of a given LCFRS
* for LCFRS files in rustomata's format
  ```bash
  cargo run -- csparsing extract examples/example.pmcfg > example.cs
  ```

* for LCFRS files in discodop's format
  ```bash
  cargo run -- csparsing extract --disco \
                                 --lexer ⟨some_lexer_file_from_discodop⟩ \
                                 ⟨some_gzipped_grammar_from_discodop⟩ \
                                 > example.cs
  ```
  * …or without lexer
    ```bash
    cargo run -- csparsing extract --disco \\
                                   ⟨some_gzipped_grammar_from_discodop⟩ \
                                   > example.cs
    ```
  
  * …or with unzipped grammar
    ```bash
    cargo run -- csparsing extract --disco \
                                   --unzipped \
                                   --lexer ⟨some_lexer_file_from_discodop⟩ \
                                   ⟨some_unzipped_grammar_from_discodop⟩ \
                                   > example.cs
    ```
  
* parse a space separated word using a Chomsky-Schützenberger representation
  ```bash
  echo "a a b c c d" | cargo run -- csparsing parse example.cs
  ```

## approximation

Rustomata contains several approximation strategies, allowing the transformation of automata with storage into other automata with storage. Available are

### multiple context-free → context-free
* approximation of an MCFG (via a tree-stack automaton) by a pushdown automaton:
  ```bash
  cargo run approximation tts automaton example.mcfg
  ```
* parse a word with the approximation automaton for the given MCFG:
  ```bash
  cargo run approximation tts parse example.mcfg
  ```
  
### context-free → context-free
* approximate a CFG (via a pushdown automaton) by a pushdown automaton using an equivalence relation on the non-terminal symbols.  An equivalence relation is defined by specifying equivalence classes:
  ```
  S [S]
  N [A,B]
  R *
  ```
  with `*` matching the remaining non-terminals.
  To get the approximation automaton:
  ```bash
  cargo run approximation relabel automaton example.cfg example.classes
  ```
* to parse with the approximation pushdown automaton:
  ```bash
  cargo run approximation relabel parse example.cfg example.classes
  ```

### context-free → recognisable
* approximation of a CFG (via a pushdown automaton) by a finite state automaton using a restriction of the underlying pushdown to height `k`:
  ```bash
  cargo run approximation ptk automaton example.cfg k
  ```
* parse with the approximation finite state automaton:
  ```bash
  cargo run approximation ptk parse grammar.gr k
  ```


## coarse-to-fine parsing

*currently being refactored*

Coarse-to-fine parsing is a feature of rustomata that applies different approximation strategies to an automaton that is created from a given cfg or mcfg grammar and then parses a word using coarse-to-fine parsing.

The coarse-to-fine parsing can be run via the following command:

* for cfg's
```bash
cargo run ctf-eval cfg grammar.cfg [Options]
```

* for mcfg's
```bash
cargo run ctf-eval mcfg grammar.mcfg [Options]
```

The options for the coarse-to-fine parsing approach are the following:

* `--tts`: that applies mcfg → cfg approximation as described under approximation (only available for mcfg's)
* `--rlb example.classes`: applies cfg → cfg or mcfg → mcfg approximation as described under approximation
* `--ptk k`: that applies cfg → cfg approximation as described under approximation (only available for cfg's or mcfg's after applying `--tts`)

In order to get started you have to choose at least one of the approximation strategies and each strategy at most once.
